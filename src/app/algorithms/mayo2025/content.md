## Overview

The Mayo Clinic algorithm represents an important contribution to our understanding of diastolic function assessment and its clinical significance, particularly concerning the prognostic implications of Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction (impaired relaxation pattern).

This algorithm maintains clear distinctions between normal diastolic function and Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction, differing from the 2016 ASE/EACVI guidelines. 

This algorithm applies specifically to patients with preserved ejection fraction (â‰¥50%) without clinical heart failure or significant valve disease.
