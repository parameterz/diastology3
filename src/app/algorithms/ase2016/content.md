## Overview

This navigator integrates the 2 algorithms from the 2016 ASE Guidelines. The "_First Algorithm_" is intended to be used on patients with normal 
function and characterizes the diastolic function as "normal" or "abnormal". 

The "_Second Algorithm_" is intended as the starting point for patients with abnormal LV systolic function or myocardial disease (like LVH, ischemia, or CMP) with normal function.

Both algorithms may resolve to "indeterminate" diastolic function in an important number of patients.

### Limitations

Notable limitations for the application of these algorithms in patients with atrial fibrillation, 
mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. It's complicated. Read the Guidelines.
