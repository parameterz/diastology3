## Overview

The British Society of Echocardiography (BSE) published updated guidelines for diastolic function assessment in 2024. These guidelines expand upon previous approaches with new parameters and dedicated algorithms for specific clinical scenarios.

### Key Innovations

The BSE guidelines introduce several important innovations:

* **Left Atrial Strain** - Incorporated as a key parameter for resolving indeterminate cases
* **Age-specific e' velocity thresholds** - Different normal values based on patient age
* **Dedicated Atrial Fibrillation Algorithm** - One of the first major guidelines to address AF specifically
* **Clearer Terminology** - Focusing on "normal" vs "impaired relaxation" and filling pressures rather than numbered grades

## Algorithm Structure

The BSE guidelines provide three separate algorithms:

* **Standard Algorithm** - For patients with normal LV systolic function
* **Dysfunction Algorithm** - For patients with reduced EF or myocardial disease with normal EF
* **Atrial Fibrillation Algorithm** - Specifically designed for patients in AF
